## Concept / Idea / Goal
It would be cool if you could reverse search pet microchips to see if your lost pet has been scanned by someone. Or even get a text when your pet's chip is scanned.

### Story 
Lost cat has rfid chip. Cat gets taken to vet. Vet scans w/ DataMars scanner
### Theory 
scan could be saved in a db which triggers API to send a text to pet parent

### How
It would take vets changing things to scan every new animal that comes in, instead of just the ones people bring in claiming to be stray.

It would take the scanner being IoT and a Twilio api to send the texts. As a pet parent, I would pay more for my chip for this
